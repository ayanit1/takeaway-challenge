Takeaway Challenge
==================

Synopsis
========

My Approach
===========
I first began reading all the material given to me and set up my workstation, meaning setting up files/folders and gems(particularly Travis CI and Coveralls, enabling them to be activated and looking at this particular build). Based on the user stories I then began to just draw a mock domain model to see potentially what classes could potentially be involved. Then after I focussed on the user stories one by one and created the program in a test development way.
